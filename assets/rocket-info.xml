            The top two floors of the spaceship are reserved for the crews' sleeping quarters.
            By having six beds per floor, the spaceship can accommodate 12 crew members.
            Stated by the Mars mission requirements, this should be enough.
            At the entrance of both rooms, the crew members are supplied with a computer desk
            which they can use to communicate with mission control or family members.
